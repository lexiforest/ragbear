# üêª Ragbear

## Why

RAG is simple, as simple as the following 10 lines of code:

```py

```

With `ragbear`, it's even simpler:

```py
ragbear.query("Who is th father of Luke Skywalker?")
```

But a lot fancier, too:

```py
ragbear.query(
    "Who is the father of Luke Skywalker?",
    model="http://localhost:8964",
    source=[
        {"data": "http://localhost:8888", "type": "meilisearch"},  # query a meilisearch database
    ],
    rerank="newest",
    rewrite="query2doc",
    template=template,
)
```

But you will need to optimize towards your academic or commercial goals, you need a framework.
However, [existing solutions are too heavy](link to reddit).

Enter Ragbear, we follow the above pattern closely, but give you options to swap each parts
of the pipeline. The code is concise and straightforward, no useless wrappers around wrappers.
Just read it.

Unlike LangChain, we do not try to encapsulate every solution out there, because there is
actually not too much to wrap at all. We would like to call ragbear a patter, rather than
a framework.

## Implemented algorithms

With ragbear, we want to incorporate the latest research ideas and put it into production.
We have implemented the following algorithms, which you can easily apply in your app.

- HyDE
- REPLUG
- Query2Doc

For example, to use the REPLUG method, it's as easy as:

```py
import ragbear

ans = ragbear.query("Where was Steve Jobs born?", rewrite="replug")
```

## Data

We support the following data query backend

- DuckDuckGo, via python package `duckduckgo_search`
- Local Dataset, via ANN engines, aks vector databases
    - hnswlib + sqlite
    - faiss + sqlite
    - pg_vector

## Dependencies

- An LLM API endpoint, you can use OpenAI API or local models with Ollama.
- An data backend, use `duckduckgo_search` or local dataset.
